I waas inspired by the game overwatch and cyberpunk 2077 games to make a arena shooter simulation.

The objects that I created are :

1.Character (The class and 'hero ' a player would choose) 

2.Weapon  (The purchasable weapons in game)

3.Map  (The map on whitch the players would play)

4.teams (The teams that they would be in be it 2 3 or 4)

5.Score (The score that would determine the winner)

6.Menu (The menu that players can acces during the game)

7.Skis (Cosmetic purpouse)

8.ScoreBoard (Players can see the score )

9.Mic  (A way for players to comunicate)

10.Ping (The comnnection to the server)
